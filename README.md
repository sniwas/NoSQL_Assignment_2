Column Family database

A column-oriented, open-source database management system (DBMS) called HBase is made to handle massive amounts of structured data. Since it's built on top of Apache Hadoop, HBase can store and handle enormous volumes of data over distributed clusters of limited hardware.

Large datasets may be read and written in real-time by using NoSQL database -Â HBase. It is frequently used in applications such as social networks, online advertising, financial services, and web analytics that need quick and random read/write access to very big databases.

Job Recuritment application is used to organize and manage the details of the companies, staffs,new appointments available.It will help the company to check their staff details , new appointment available and professional details of the staffs.This configuration includes,

Company name,Revenue_in_Cr,Market_Value,Total_Employees
Staff_Details HR,Basic_Pay,Location
New_Ap av_se,te_ids

I used the following terms to do the desired operation:

1)put - The values of the family in the table are updated and added using the "put" keyword.
2)scan - The table's entities are displayed using the "scan" keyword.
3)create - The table is created with the "create" keyword .
4)delete - The value and the table can both be deleted using the "delete" keyword.

Column-family databases are an effective tool for managing data, and as businesses continue to produce and gather more and more data, their use will likely increase.
